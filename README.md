### Deploy contract

#### General config

- The deploy script we're using is located in `script/IPNFT.sol`
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- Set the `PRIVATE_KEY` variable in the `.env`. This is the private key for the address you're deploying the contract with. For testing you can generate a private key on your command line: `openssl rand -hex 32`.
- Set the `ETHERSCAN_KEY` if you want to verify deployed contracts on Etherscan.

#### Deploy to a local `anvil` node

1. Anvil is a local testnet node shipped with Foundry. You can use it for testing your contracts from frontends or for interacting over RPC.
2. Run `anvil -h 0.0.0.0` in a terminal window and keep it running. You will see similar output to this:

3. Take one of the private keys you get and insert them into the `.env` file at `PRIVATE_KEY`.
4. Run `source .env` to get the ENV variables into your current terminal session.
5. Run `forge script script/IPNFT.s.sol:IPNFTScript --fork-url $ANVIL_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast -vvvv` to deploy the contract to your local `anvil` node.
6. If the deployment was successful you get output similar to this:

7. Using `cast` (which is part of Foundry) you can now query/manipulate your deployed contract. Find out more here: https://book.getfoundry.sh/cast/

#### Deploy to Goerli Testnet

1. Make sure you have a private key in your `.env` file that has Goerli Testnet ETH on it. Otherwise you won't be able to deploy a contract because of insufficient funds.
2. Run `source .env` to get the ENV variables into your current terminal session.
3. Run `forge script script/IPNFT.s.sol:IPNFTScript --fork-url $GOERLI_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast -vvvv` or if you want to also verify the contract on Etherscan `forge script script/IPNFT.s.sol:IPNFTScript --fork-url $GOERLI_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --verify --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_KEY --broadcast -vvvv` .
